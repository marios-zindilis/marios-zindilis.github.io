    <h2 id="about-me">About me</h2>

<p>Born in 1979, currently living in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin" title="WikiPedia page for Dublin, Ireland">Dublin, Ireland</a>. 
Previously, I lived for 10 years in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens" title="WikiPedia page for Athens, Greece">Athens, Greece</a>, and 
the rest at my hometown of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limassol" title="WikiPedia page for Limassol, Cyprus">Limassol, Cyprus</a>.</p>

<h3 id="work">Work</h3>

<p>I currently work as a Systems Development Engineer at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/" title="Amazon">Amazon</a>. I have 
previously worked as a Senior Systems Administrator and prior to that as a 
Linux Systems Administrator at <a href="http://primetel.com.cy/" title="PrimeTel">PrimeTel</a>, and earlier at PrimeTel’s 
<abbr title="Network Operations Center">NOC</abbr>, at <a href="http://lapsoco.com/" title="Lapso Co Ltd">Lapso Co Ltd</a>, 
<a href="http://www.mastersoft.com.cy/">MasterSoft</a>, 
<a href="http://www.domcons.com/">DomCons Ltd</a> and 
<a href="http://www.entropydata.com/">Entropy Data Ltd</a>.</p>

<p>I have also done some web development as a freelancer (hasn’t everybody?), and 
I manage a few servers on the side, offering shared and dedicated web hosting.</p>

<h3 id="education">Education</h3>

<p>I started studying <a href="http://www.arch.ntua.gr/">Architecture</a> at 
<abbr title="National Technological University of Athens">NTUA</abbr>, but 
gave it up. I then studied Computer Science 
at <a href="http://www.intercollege.ac.cy/">InterCollege</a>.</p>

<p>At one point or another I obtained the following certifications:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cisco Certified Entry Network Technician</li>
  <li>Cisco Certified Network Associate (#CSCO11919413, 2011-05-06 - 2014-05-05)</li>
  <li>CompTIA Linux+ (#COMP001020362554, 2012-04-20)</li>
  <li>Linux Professionals Institute Certification LPIC-1 (2012-04-20 - 2017-04-20)</li>
  <li>Linux Professionals Institute Certification LPIC-2 (#LPI000251981, 2013-10-18 - 2018-10-18)</li>
  <li>Novell Certified Linux Administrator</li>
  <li>Novell Certified Data Center Technical Specialist</li>
  <li>Novell Certified SUSE 11 Technical Specialist</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="other">Other</h3>

<p>I am an amateur musician. Over the years I have owned and unsuccessfully tried 
to learn to play a bunch of instruments (acoustic, classic and electric guitar, 
guitar bass, bouzouki, zither, bayan, harmonica and possibly others that I 
forget). At some point I sold or gave away everything but my first guitar, an 
Ibanez PF-10, bought in 1999.</p>

<p>I also once liked to aggregate useless stuff, but more recently I find more 
meaning in owning as less stuff as possible. I gave away my small collection 
of about 100 vinyl records, gifted another collection of about 400 miniature 
cars to friends with kids, and donated or recycled a few hundreds of books.</p>

<h2 id="about-this-website">About this website</h2>

<p>This blog is my blah in the global interwebs.</p>

<h3 id="platform">Platform</h3>

<p>This website is maintained with Zalza, my Python script for generating 
static HTML from Markdown text files.</p>

<p>Previously, the blog part of the site was the awesome WordPress, and 
the docs part was the very readable, very usable and very frustrating 
to hack MediaWiki. Having spent hours and hours checking out the code 
of the two, I concluded that A. WordPress is poetry, and B. it is a 
miracle that MediaWiki even works.</p>

<h3 id="appearance">Appearance</h3>

<p>Currently, this website uses Twitter Bootstrap for its visual appearance, with 
a few minor style changes.</p>

<p>In its previous iteration, it used Bootstrap with the SpaceLab theme.</p>

<p>Previously, while being far from a designer, I had stitched 
together the looks of this website from the dead bodies of other looks 
that I liked and dissected, and I ended up liking it. The theme for that 
version started from Modernist, a WordPress theme by Rodrigo Galindez, 
with endless small modifications. However, the fonts were mostly ripped 
off of Vector, the default theme for MediaWiki.</p>
